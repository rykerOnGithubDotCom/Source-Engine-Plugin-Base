# Source Engine Plugin Base
 A modified version of the plugin sample in the [Source Engine SDK 2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013) as an empty base. It also comes with a Visual Studio 2013 solution to make setup easier.
 
It is unknown if this base is compatible with non-windows operating systems.

# Setup
Open the command prompt and change the directory to your project folder. Then proceed to create a symbolic link using the following command

___mklink /D "source-sdk-2013" "PATH TO SDK HERE"___

Then make sure to change the solution/project name to the name of your plugin as well as the output file name in the properties.
